# SPA-Example
SPA experience example using only JQuery and HTML.

<img alt="jQuery" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/jquery%20-%230769AD.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=jquery&logoColor=white"/><img alt="HTML5" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/html5%20-%23E34F26.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white"/>

<hr />

- You can have similar effect that you find using React, Angular and Vue;
- I use this technique to many HTML5 projects, and works perfectly;
- Load your website just one time, and make the navigation and UX much better.

Just download both files, RUN IT ON A WEB SERVER. This doesn't work locally!

Have fun! +_+
